# Shiny tealeaves

Leaf temperature is an important control on photosynthesis, drought stress, and transpiration. At ecosystem scale, the effects of temperature on individual leaves may have important implications for carbon and water cycling.

This application simulates leaf temperature using a model described in [Jones (2013)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9780511845727/type/book) and recently applied in [Still et al. (2022)](https://pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2205682119). Use the sliders at the left to modify the input parameters. The "Energy budget" tab gives more detail on the conditions you specify while the "Sensitivity plot" tab lets you see how temperature changes as a result of another parameter. More details on each component are given below.
